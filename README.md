Current system only officially supports x86-64 Linux systems. The shift away from Assembly should now allow it to be compiled on any UNIX-like. If any issues are found on UNIX-like systems, then report that in the Issues tab. Do not report issues for non-POSIX systems (i.e. Windows et al.) as this program is not yet meant to run on those systems.

To compile and run use the provided .bash script.

```./bitchat.bash```

As it does currently ship with training data, it must be trained by the end user. You can \ train it yourself with this .bash script.

```./training.bash```
